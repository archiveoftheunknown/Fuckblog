MOBILE VIEWPORT ZOOM - GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT
==============================================

Download: "mobile-viewport-zoom.tar.gz"

WHAT'S CHANGED:
---------------
✓ Site now starts zoomed out to 75% on mobile (like pinch-to-zoom)
✓ Users can zoom in/out from 75% to 500% 
✓ Removed CSS scaling - site elements stay normal size
✓ Content appears smaller in viewport (shows more at once)
✓ Works like Chrome's mobile zoom feature

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
The viewport meta tag now sets:
- initial-scale=0.75 (starts at 75% zoom)
- minimum-scale=0.75 (can't zoom out more than 75%)
- maximum-scale=5 (can zoom in up to 500%)

This makes the browser show more content at once on mobile,
similar to pinching to zoom out on your phone.

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------
1. Extract mobile-viewport-zoom.tar.gz
2. Upload ALL files to your GitHub repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → main branch → root folder)
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

Your site: https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/

FILES INCLUDED:
--------------
- index.html (with viewport zoom settings)
- 404.html (for client-side routing)
- assets/ folder (CSS & JavaScript)
