                This is a personal archive of political commentary and analysis. I am Velo, an independent observer of Indonesian politics. The views expressed here are entirely my own and do not represent any organization, political party, or government entity.
              </p>
              <p>
                All content published here is commentary and opinion based on publicly available information. This is not investigative journalism or official reporting - it's my personal analysis and interpretation of political events and trends in Indonesia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Readers should understand that political commentary is inherently subjective. I encourage you to verify information independently and form your own opinions based on multiple sources.

                <li>Provide context for complex political events</li>

                I aim for thoughtful analysis rather than sensationalism, though my personal perspectives inevitably influence the commentary. This is not neutral reporting - it's informed opinion.
